The code to the paper "Simultaneous upscaling of two properties of reservoirs in one dimension using adaptive bandwidth in kernel function method". For more information please visit our paper at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876380419602326. A further investigation of this paper is to apply the same method on a 3D environment where my code can be accessed here at https://github.com/esysss/Petroleum-3D/tree/main.
